### .init

Hi there 👋

I've been writing code for the web and app since 2012.<br>
Trying not to hate `JavaScript` since last 3 years. 🤮 <br>
Some of my works are listed on my [portfolio](https://nirola.tech).

### .code
I use GitHub mostly to store and synchronize my work.<br>
I everyday tech stack includes
 - [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org): Mostly NextJS 🧑🏻‍💻
 - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org): Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript.
 - [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3): Ethereum, Wallets 🪙
 - [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/): The utility based css framework 💅🏻
 - [AWS](https://aws.com): The web 🕸
